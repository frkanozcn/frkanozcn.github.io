        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I started my career in 2018 as a Java developer and worked in web application development and maintenance projects for banking and healthcare management systems in Yapı Kredi and Mergen Software, respectively. In these places, I familiarized myself with Spring and Spring Boot frameworks in addition to various front-end frameworks like Vaadin and Angular. Consequently, I have had experience with build automation tools like Maven, Ant as well as ORM tools like Hibernate. I have also used/written RESTful APIs in the Angular based projects. These projects that I took part in also gave me the opportunity to enhance my knowledge in TypeScript, HTML and CSS on which Angular is based. On top of all these things, I have learned how to code collectively with a group of developers in big CI/CD processes, which has sharpened my ability to write readable, robust, maintainable, and extensible code.

After being involved in web development, I decided to take a different path in my career and started to work at TEI (TUSAS Engine Industries), an aerospace engine manufacturer in Turkey. In this company, I develop desktop apps that communicate with embedded software via measurement and calibration protocols like CCP and XCP. All the apps we develop here in TEI uses Qt framework. Qt framework has C++ and QML (Qt Modeling Language) integration via signal handling mechanism, direct type conversion between C++ and QML, ready-to-use and extendable QML types, and C++ libraries and classes. By using Qt, I could utilize my earlier OOP knowledge in a different language like C++ as well as improving my skills in scripting languages thanks to QML which uses and extends JavaScript syntax. In TEI, I am directly involved in integration and deployment processes. This new experience in this company encourages me to give more importance to documentation processes which save time in future development work. Recently, I slightly shifted my focus to improve workflow, and work item tracking methods for my team by using Azure DevOps. I took active role creating new board structures, work item templates, automation scripts.

In summary, in these five years I have experienced different working environments, software development methodologies like waterfall and agile, version control systems like SVN and Git, DevOps services like Azure DevOps, various frameworks and languages like Qt, Angular, Spring, C++, and Java. They all have helped strengthen my ability in experimenting with fundamentals like design patterns and data structures and keep them fresh throughout my career as a software engineer. All these attempts and experiences have proven themselves helpful in boosting my confidence and feeding my hunger to try and learn new things in various places with new tools and technologies.

            <h3>Summer Internship, <span style="color: #31a16c">Turkcell Global Bilgi</span></h3>
            <p>I performed basic DB table normalizations, and mapped relation of tables. I spent two weeks in this short-term internship.</p>

            <h3>Summer Internship, <span style="color: #31a16c">Hyundai Assan</span></h3>
            <p>I created a web app for error log monitoring by using C#, and ASP.NET framework. Error logs for each department can be watched by authorized people only. I managed login operations using Active Directory. User info after login is used by the app to query from a simple database that has the information of the relation between logs, departments, and users.</p>

            <h3>Software Developer, <span style="color: #31a16c">Yapı Kredi</span></h3>
            <p>I spent 1,5 years as junior web developer in Yapı Kredi. During this period, I worked with Hibernate, Maven, and Java. I used MySQL as DB. I wrote backend services and modules with Java.</p>
        </div>
		<div class="project">
            <h3>Software Developer, <span style="color: #31a16c">Mergen Software</span></h3>
            <p>Similar to Yapı Kredi, I worked as web developer. For the first time, I used Spring Boot for standalone modules. I created and used RESTful API’s using Java. I used Vaadin which is a front-end framework written in Java. Then, I switched to Angular as the frontend framework in the second half of my career in Mergen.</p>

            <h3>Software Engineer, <span style="color: #31a16c">TEI</span></h3>
            <p>I started my career in TEI as a mid-level software engineer at TEI. I created various desktop apps and performed maintenance tasks for existing apps. I was responsible for development and maintenance of complex desktop applications like GMTs (Ground Maintenance Tool) for military engines as well as small-scaled integration and automation tools for couple of teams, including mine, in my company. I familiarized with C++ and Qt Framework. I used Qt’s and some of C++ STL libraries for backend development. For the frontend, I used both Qt Widget (C++ based GUI module) and QML (Qt Modeling Language in Quick module). Because of having the experience with Java, my adaptation for C++ was relatively easy as it is a language that also supports OOP paradigm.</p>

            <h3>Senior Software Engineer, <span style="color: #31a16c">TEI</span></h3>
            <p>I got a promotion, and my title changed to senior software engineer in May 2022. In addition to previous activities, I slightly shifted my focus onto Microsoft’s Azure DevOps tools to ease the workload when my team started transition to Agile methodologies.</p>
